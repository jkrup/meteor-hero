1. Build the meteor application to BUILD_DIR (Default: `~/.meteor-hero/builds`)
2. Unzip the contents of the built meteor application
3. Write a Dockerfile in the BUILD_DIR
4. Create a new heroku instance with a MongoDB addon and set the appropriate env variables
5. Release the heroku container and print the URL where it is accessible


# Usage
```
    meteor-hero [options] <command>

  Description:
    This program is designed to be run inside of a MeteorJS project and will do the following:

      1) Build the meteor application to BUILD_DIR (Default: ~/.meteor-hero/builds)
      2) Unzip the contents of the built meteor application
      3) Write a Dockerfile in the BUILD_DIR
      4) Create a new heroku instance with a MongoDB addon and set the appropriate env variables
      5) Release the heroku container and print the URL where it is accessible

    Note: If run outside of a meteor application, may crash due to `meteor build` failing

  Options:
    -h                 Displays help message
    -b DIR             Overwrite BUILD_DIR
    -e VAR=value       Environment variables to set on the deployed heroku instance.
    -E `FILE`          Env file to be read for environment variables to be set.
    -s `FILE`          Meteor settings file to be set as METEOR_SETTINGS environment variable.

  Commands:
    []  By default deploys a MeteorJS application to heroku.
    -u  Update instead of creating a new url, update the previous deploy. The file .heroku_app_name must exist and contain the previous app name.

  Examples:

  – Deploy with environment variables

    $ meteor-hero -e MONGO_URL="mongodb://user:pass@example.mongo.com" -e ROOT_URL="example.net"`

  – Deploy using env file

    $ meteor-hero -E prod.env

  – Deploy with Meteor settings file

    $ meteor-hero -s settings.json
```
